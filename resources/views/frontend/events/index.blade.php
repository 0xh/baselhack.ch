                        you meet, connect and collaborate with tech enthusiasts, creative minds, data specialist, design
                        wizards and visionaries.

                        Bring your own idea or join a team to create a running prototype that can be presented to a
                        panel of judges and the Basel Area audience.

                      Your prototype will be published Open Source and hopefully live on beyond the event, being
                        developed for the region.
